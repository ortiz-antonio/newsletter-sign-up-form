### What I learned

In this project, I'm experimenting with UnoCSS and design tokens while implementing a progressive enhancement approach for form validation. This involves starting with HTML5 native validation and extending functionality with JavaScript

### Continued development
I plan to break down my components further to improve reusability.
I'm not entirely comfortable maintaining separate components for the success dialog and confirmation page rather than reusing a single component.
